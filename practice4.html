                        <p>
                            Vincent Willem van Gogh was born on 30 March 1853 in Groot-Zundert, in the predominantly
                            Catholic
                            province of North Brabant in the southern Netherlands.He was the oldest surviving child of
                            Theodorus
                            van Gogh.

                            Van Gogh drew and painted with watercolours while at school, but only a few examples survive
                            and the
                            authorship of some has been challenged.When he took up art as an adult, he began at an
                            elementary
                            level.

                        <p>
                            On 27 July 1890, aged 37, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver.There were no
                            witnesses. The shooting may have taken place in the wheat field in which he had been
                            painting, or a
                            local barn.

                        Sunflowers are the subject of two series of still life paintings by the Dutch painter Vincent
                        van Gogh. The earlier series, executed in Paris in 1887, depicts the flowers lying on the
                        ground, while the second set, executed a year later in Arles, shows bouquets of sunflowers in a
                        vase.In the artist's mind both sets were linked by the name of his friend Paul Gauguin, who
                        acquired two of the Paris versions.
                    </p>
                    <p>About eight months later Van Gogh hoped to welcome and to
                        impress Gauguin again with Sunflowers, now part of the painted Décoration for the Yellow House
                        that he prepared for the guestroom of his home in Arles, where Gauguin was supposed to stay.
                        After Gauguin's departure, Van Gogh imagined the two major versions as wings of the Berceuse
                        Triptych, and finally he included them in his Les XX in Bruxelles exhibit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The two Sunflowers in
                        question show two buttons each; one of them was preceded by a small study, and a fourth large
                        canvas combines both compositions. These were Van Gogh's first paintings with "nothing but
                        sunflowers"—yet, he had already included sunflowers in still life and landscape earlier.
