                    <p>
                        On 27 July 1890, aged 37, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver.There were no witnesses. The shooting may have taken place in the wheat field in which he had been painting, or a local barn.

                    <p>
                        Van Gogh drew and painted with watercolours while at school, but only a few examples survive and the authorship of some has been challenged.When he took up art as an adult, he began at an elementary level.

                        Sunflowers are the subject of two series of still life paintings by the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh. The earlier series, executed in Paris in 1887, depicts the flowers lying on the ground, while the second set, executed a year later in Arles, shows bouquets of sunflowers in a vase.In the artist's mind both sets were linked by the name of his friend Paul Gauguin, who acquired two of the Paris versions. About eight months later Van Gogh hoped to welcome and to impress Gauguin again with Sunflowers, now part of the painted Décoration for the Yellow House that he prepared for the guestroom of his home in Arles, where Gauguin was supposed to stay. After Gauguin's departure, Van Gogh imagined the two major versions as wings of the Berceuse Triptych, and finally he included them in his Les XX in Bruxelles exhibit.
